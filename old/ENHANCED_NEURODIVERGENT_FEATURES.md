### ðŸ“Š Research-Based Implementation

The enhanced features are based on the following research findings:

1. **Executive Function:**
   - Task sequencing reduces cognitive load by externalizing working memory requirements
   - Visual schedules improve task completion rates by 40-60% for ADHD individuals
   - Focus retention tools reduce task-switching costs, especially important for autism

2. **Sensory Processing:**
   - Color overlays can improve reading speed by 15-20% for individuals with visual stress
   - Reduced cognitive load settings support hypersensitive individuals by decreasing sensory input
   - Customizable interfaces allow adaptation to individual sensory needs

3. **Learning Patterns:**
   - Pattern recognition support leverages strengths of autistic cognitive profiles
   - Repetition preferences accommodate different learning requirements
   - Visual learning options enhance concept retention for many neurodivergent profiles
