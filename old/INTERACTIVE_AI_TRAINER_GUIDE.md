- Configure 1-5 input features
- Label your training examples for easy tracking

### 2. **Real Neural Network Training**
- Actual backpropagation algorithm (not simulated!)
- Watch live training metrics:
  - Epochs (training iterations)
  - Accuracy (how well it learns)
  - Loss (error reduction over time)
- Early stopping when accuracy reaches 95%
- Gradient descent with adaptive learning

### 3. **Interactive Testing**
- Test your trained model with ANY inputs you want
- See predictions in real-time

2. **Start Over**:
   - Click "Start Over" to train a new model
   - Previous model is cleared

3. **Complete**:
   - Click "Complete" to return to modules
   - Your score is based on model accuracy

## ðŸ“Š Real-World Example: Email Spam Detector

### Setup:
- **Model Type**: Classification
- **Inputs**: 3
  - Input 1: "Number of Spam Words" (0-10)
  - Input 2: "Has Suspicious Links" (0 or 1)
  - Input 3: "Sender Reputation" (0-10)
- **Output**: "Is Spam" (0 = Not Spam, 1 = Spam)

### Training Data:
1. [8, 1, 2] â†’ 1 (Spam: many spam words, has links, low reputation)
2. [1, 0, 9] â†’ 0 (Not Spam: few spam words, no links, high reputation)
3. [0, 0, 10] â†’ 0 (Not Spam: no spam words, no links, perfect reputation)
4. [10, 1, 0] â†’ 1 (Spam: all spam words, has links, no reputation)
5. [3, 1, 5] â†’ 1 (Spam: some spam words, has links, medium reputation)
6. [2, 0, 7] â†’ 0 (Not Spam: few spam words, no links, good reputation)

### Test Cases:
- [5, 1, 3] â†’ Prediction: 1 (Spam) - 85% confidence
- [1, 0, 8] â†’ Prediction: 0 (Not Spam) - 92% confidence
- [7, 0, 4] â†’ Prediction: ? (See what your AI thinks!)

## ðŸ§  How It Works (Technical)

### Neural Network Architecture:
```
Input Layer (your features)
    â†“
Hidden Layer (4 neurons with sigmoid activation)
    â†“
Output Layer (1 neuron)
    â†“
Prediction
```

### Training Algorithm:
1. **Forward Pass**:
   - Calculate hidden layer: `h = sigmoid(input Ã— weights1 + bias1)`
   - Calculate output: `out = sigmoid(hidden Ã— weights2 + bias2)`

2. **Calculate Error**:
   - `error = actual - predicted`
   - `loss = errorÂ²`

3. **Backward Pass** (Backpropagation):
   - Update output weights: `w2 += learning_rate Ã— error Ã— hidden`
   - Update hidden weights: `w1 += learning_rate Ã— gradient Ã— inputs`

4. **Repeat**:
   - Process all examples (shuffled)
   - Run for multiple epochs
   - Stop when accuracy is high enough

### Activation Function:
- **Sigmoid**: `f(x) = 1 / (1 + e^(-x))`
- Maps any number to 0-1 range
- Perfect for classification and probabilities

## ðŸ’¡ Pro Tips

### For Best Results:

1. **Diverse Data**:
   - Include examples from different scenarios
   - Cover edge cases
   - Balance between classes (equal 0s and 1s)

2. **More Examples**:
   - 5-10 minimum
   - 20-30 optimal
   - 50+ for complex patterns

3. **Normalized Inputs**:
   - Keep values in similar ranges
   - Example: Use 0-10 scale for all inputs
   - Helps training converge faster

4. **Test Thoroughly**:
   - Try values you didn't train on
   - Test extremes (very low/high)
   - Check if patterns make sense

### Common Issues:

**Low Accuracy (<70%)**:
- Add more training examples
- Check if data has clear patterns
- Ensure output values are consistent

**Overfitting** (100% training accuracy but poor testing):
- Add more diverse examples
- Test with very different inputs
- Simplify the problem

**Slow Training**:
- Reduce number of examples
- Enable reduced motion in accessibility settings
- Wait patiently (max 10 seconds)

## ðŸŽ“ Learning Concepts

### What You're Learning:

1. **Supervised Learning**:
   - AI learns from labeled examples
   - You provide the "answers" (outputs)
   - AI finds patterns to predict new cases

2. **Neural Networks**:
   - Layers of connected neurons
   - Weights adjusted during training
   - Non-linear patterns detected

3. **Backpropagation**:
   - How AI corrects mistakes
   - Gradient descent optimization
   - Error flows backward through network

4. **Generalization**:
   - AI learns rules, not memorizes examples
   - Can predict for unseen inputs
   - The goal of machine learning!
