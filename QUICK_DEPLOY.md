# ðŸš€ Quick Deployment to GitHub Pages

## One-Command Setup

If you're ready to deploy immediately, follow these steps:

### 1. Set Your Repository Name

Make sure the `base` path in `vite.config.ts` matches your repository name:

```typescript
// If your repo is: https://github.com/username/my-app
// Then base should be:
base: '/my-app/',

// Current setting:
base: '/learnonauts/',
```

### 2. Create GitHub Repository

```bash
# On GitHub, create a new repository named 'learnonauts' (or your preferred name)
# Then run:

git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/learnonauts.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### 3. Add API Key Secret

1. Go to: `https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/learnonauts/settings/secrets/actions`
2. Click **New repository secret**
3. Name: `VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY`
4. Value: Your Gemini API key
5. Click **Add secret**

### 4. Enable GitHub Pages

1. Go to: `https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/learnonauts/settings/pages`
2. Under **Source**, select: **GitHub Actions**
3. Save

### 5. Deploy!

**Option A: Automatic (Recommended)**
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Deploy to GitHub Pages"
git push
```
